    "    - Can analyze a TS based on the assumption that it is composed of sine and cosine waves w/ diff frequencies. A device that we can measure w/ is called the **periodogram** which derives from detecting and estimating while buried in noise, the amplitude of a sine component, of known frequency. The **periodogram** can also be used to check the residuals after fitting a model.\n",

    "    - The **autocorrelation func** $ \\Leftrightarrow $ **spectral density func** as in they transform each other. Both highlights diff aspsects of the data. Obtaining sample estimates of both are considered **nonstructural approaches** which an anology can be used. That is, representing an **empirical distribution func** by a histogram. All components of this analogy provide a first step in the analysis of the TS and in the distributional analysis of data, respectively. \n",
